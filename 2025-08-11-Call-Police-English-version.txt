- If there's a problem with complaints without follow-up, you need to deal with the justice system, not the police.  
- But except that I receive a decision from the police. There's a service called online complaint.  
- But online complaint, that's not where they say it's classified without follow-up, it's not on the online complaints site. Pre-complaints.  
- Yet it is. So after, I don't know if you can type "online complaint." I don't know if you've ever...  
- And so the online appointment service, is that going to work again or do I have to go in person?  
- I have no idea, sir. I'm not in IT and I'm not in complaints.  
- But what are you in, then?  
- I'm in emergencies.  
- And so this isn't urgent? How do you judge that it's not urgent?  
- Because I don't want to send someone to check that your online pre-complaint went through, sir.  
- But you haven't asked me anything at all, actually...  
- Because you have a chip in your body, is that it?  
- But have you asked me that first or not?  
- I don't know, I'm aware, so you see, we know everything. You're saying I don't know your problem, but I know your problem, it's that you have a chip in your body.  
- Okay, alright, but starting from there, what happens then? I wait, that's it?  
- For that, it's not me who's going to come remove the chip.  
- Yes, but you could talk differently too. Why are you talking to me like that? Is it up to me to remove it, actually? Is it up to me to remove it?  
- Well, it's not me or 17 who's going to remove it for you, sir. And who's going to remove it, then? Well, I don't know, the hospital. And then, ask them to remove it for you, sir.  
- And if the hospital doesn't remove it, what do I do? Well, I don't know. But you don't know much, apparently.  
- Well, that's it.  
- But you say you know, actually, you don't know. It's complicated, actually.  
- Oh yeah?  
- Oh yes.  
- Okay, but what do I do then? I wait, I wait? I stay there, I wait?  
- Well no, you can go to the hospital and ask if they can remove the chip you have in your body.  
- Except that the hospital, no one's competent anymore today [that's what I've been told, it's documented, not me saying it, and the medical board has been seized for months]. So what do I do, what levers are left?  
- I don't know, in any case it's not the police that removes chips from bodies. Yeah but the police can try to find out how it got there. Are there other people? Okay. Basically, the solution is to wait.  
- After that, you do what you want, sir.  
- As I want, but I have a choice, then. Do I have a choice?  
- Yes, we always have a choice, sir.  
- What's the choice, then? What are the choices I have? Either go to the hospital to have the chip removed, or wait. In any case, you're not the right number. 17 and 18, that's not...  
- Yes, but anyway, it's never the right number. I'm starting to get used to it.  
- There you go, sir.  
- OK, goodbye.
