# Correspondence with Lamy Immobilier – Eviction Procedure (Nancy, November 2025)

Full English translation – Published evidence of institutional stonewalling in the context of organized harassment

**Date:** ~20–22 November 2025  
**Subject:** Formal notice before publication – Eviction notice received despite months of attempts at dialogue

Hello,

Despite the messages below and my attempts to contact the owners directly on social media (0 replies or half-replies the moment I mention the real problem), I received an eviction notice today.

You can’t even speak to the landlords anymore? What kind of world is this?

So:

1. I moved into the flat with no guarantee of future income (I was registered with Pôle Emploi). Who does that? Who is mad enough?  
   Result: exactly what we are witnessing today. In my view, at the beginning it was a reckless leap forward, a poker bluff, just to gain time until they realised the full scale of the problem surrounding me (because yes, there is one — see https://www.change.org/stop_torturing_T_Moudiki). It is far wider and far more internationally documented than anyone wants to believe.

2. I have been sending you dozens of emails for months trying to find a solution — including, on my side, the desperate counter-bluff of offering to be paid to leave (a practice that does exist).

3. The CAF has also stopped paying you, and I still don’t really know why (although now, after the break-ins, the front door left wide open for days, the deliberately clogged pipes…).  
   Either it is an attempt to force me to pay something that is objectively impossible (read the link), or it is a refusal to continue participating in what is clearly a prolonged misuse of public funds / abuse of social assets (which you will probably have to repay one day).

4. FSL file? I will apply. But it’s the same story — misuse of public funds that will have to be reimbursed in the end.

5. The winter eviction truce ends on 31 March 2026, which gives us time to talk — even if it has to be every single day. It also demonstrates your lack of courage: the letter could have been sent before the truce, when I was still proactively trying to understand the situation.

The overall context described in the link is what everyone refuses to look at.  
It seems the only two options on the table are: either deploy extremely heavy and costly repressive measures, or finally grant me the social assistance I should have received years ago.

“How can Thierry Moudiki find a job?” and “Why is it that, as if by magic, I am now completely alone in the world?”  
Those are the two questions that will eventually bring this wall of silence crashing down.

I therefore formally request, once again, an in-person or telephone meeting with you.

In 25 years in France, for the first 18 years (i.e. before this campaign of systemic violence began), I always paid everything on time. This can easily be verified with my former landlords, SFR, LCL, etc.  
Does anyone ever check?

Kind regards,  
T. Moudiki

Exactly…  
Do you even know the amount of my arrears? More than €6,000.  
So what?

The context is now well documented (work in progress):

Hello Sir,

Mrs TORTERAT informed me that the Family Allowance Office contacted her and that she sent back the documents they requested on Monday.

I am only dealing with your rent arrears. Mrs TORTERAT has taken the necessary steps regarding your apartment.

Best regards

Hello Mrs Vauthier, Mrs Torterat,

Thank you for your reply — a rare luxury these days.

I think it is necessary to reply in the current context, because silence from the other party only fuels and reinforces suspicion. Absence of response is visible and is interpreted as a response in itself.  
Rational behaviour would be: inability to pay rent (+ international context of employment discrimination + institutional and state harassment) → search for an amicable then judicial solution according to the rules in force.  
But in my current life there are no longer any rules or fundamental rights. Even the owner, whom I tried to contact on social media, is avoiding me. No reply either to my proposal to be paid to leave this hell.

Regarding the CAF: they regularly send me emails to take stock of the situation.  
From the information I send them, it is clear that the problem lies elsewhere — not linked to the state of the property (someone did come to check), but probably linked to this (a thinly veiled attempt at elimination, particularly through “administrative drowning”):  
https://www.change.org/stop_torturing_T_Moudiki

Still no rational, constructive questions that would bring the truth to light. Only silence, astonishing impunity and evasion.

In my view, given what I communicate to them, the way I was able to move into the flat (no guarantee of future income), and what I have experienced in the flat (particularly violent — and whether you like it or not, this will one day fall under your responsibility or that of Nexity), the CAF is simply refusing to be an accomplice any longer in prolonged abuse of social assets, when the fraud is obvious to any normally constituted person.

So I stand by my request: I need an appointment.  
Unless you tell me the police are already questioning you about this and there is no point. Otherwise, if no appointment, we are living in Wonderland, swimming in delusion, and humanity no longer exists (I very much doubt the last scenario — people don’t murder someone live on world television).

Kind regards,  
T. Moudiki

Hello Mr MOUDIKI,

I wrote again last week to the Family Allowance Office but have not received a reply.  
Since they have suspended payments due to the property being declared uninhabitable, you can also try contacting them to unblock the situation.

Regarding your arrears, we have not received any payment since October 2024.

I advise you to contact a social worker so that they can put together an FSL (Housing Solidarity Fund) file to cover your debt.

Best regards  
Emeline VAUTHIER

Hello,

The situation regarding the message below is at a complete standstill.

And I cannot / will not be able to perform miracles (see https://www.change.org/stop_torturing_T_Moudiki).

I have exhausted all avenues, even trying to contact the owner directly.

Without success.

When can we meet? Who can I meet?

What does the CAF tell you — the same CAF that is no longer paying you either?

Kind regards,  
T. Moudiki
