Subject: Before the hearing – Context you cannot pretend not to see

Hello,

Ahead of the court hearing, I invite you to read the context (it speaks for itself) here – and in the previous exchanges as well:  
https://www.change.org/stop_torturing_T_Moudiki

I invite you, and everyone else, to stop pretending you have suddenly lost your brain and to finally ask the right questions without dodging a single one.

You also write that I can be represented by a whole list of people with special power of lawyer.  
However, given that in almost 10 years I have managed to have a lawyer exactly **once** (for a few hours only), and even after I filed a complaint with the disciplinary board I never understood why, there is a very real chance that the threats you put **in bold** will actually materialise (and they are nothing less than a summary of my life for the past decade):

> “If you do not do so, you expose yourself to a judgment being rendered against you based solely on the evidence provided by your opponent.”

Be aware, nevertheless, that this entire situation is already known to:  
- the French judiciary (two ongoing complaints for institutional harassment in two different courts),  
- police forces around the world  
- “journalists” around the world  
- and the European Court of Human Rights.

So do not come back later and say you “never received anything” – this email is more than sufficient proof.

Kind regards,  
T. Moudiki
